# Welcome to Bug Wrangler Ranch

This first self-assessment is for you to hone several Core Skills that you need as a software developer.

Taking your time now to be thorough, reflective, patient and curious will give you the foundation to be successful throughout the rest of this course and your career.

If you rush this, or think of it as a test to be "passed", then you will already be on the wrong path.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Description

Slim Jenkins offers a vacation package for people who have always wanted to join a cattle driving team across the American Midwest.

He calls it the **Kansas Slim's Cattle Adventure**.

People join a team of experienced drovers who will train them in the basics of herding cattle and driving them across hundreds of miles to their destination at Old Red's Ranch.

Unfortunately, someone gained access to the code that produces an outline of the adventure to the paying customers, so Slim has hired you to examine and fix the code.

## Learning Objectives

Here are your learning objectives for this self-assessment.

1. Able to use the debugger to step through existing code to discover root causes of bugs.
2. Drawing a sequence diagram for a project.
   > Use the [sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/) site to generate your sequence diagram. Make sure you save your work as you go.
3. Demonstrate learning efficiency by researching concepts you haven't seen before using your peers, mentors, and the World Wide Web as resources.
4. Awareness of when you need help, and then seeking it out.

## Example Output

If you are able to fix all of the bugs, you will output similar to what is below. It will not be identical, but similar.

```sh

You will be accompanying 5 drovers as they drive 50 cattle to Old Red's Ranch for grazing

The herd is made of up the following types of cattle:
Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,American Angus,Brown Swiss,
Ankina,American Angus,Ankina,Brown Swiss,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,
Brown Swiss,American Angus,Ankina,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,

Here is the team of drovers you will be joining
        * Melvyn Hethron
        * Yancy Gresley
        * Willabella Attarge
        * Ynes Gyenes
        * Farlie Spere


Your journey will take you through the wildness of the American Midwest and across the following terrain
        * forest
        * plain
        * river
        * mountain
```

1. In the **main** module, one of the first lines of code is `const drovers = hireDrovers(cattleToDrive)`. Explain what the value of the `drovers` variable is when that line of code runs.
   > drovers is an array[]:    The value of drovers here is equal to the output of the hireDrovers function with the input from the cattleToDrive constant. that value of drovers is an array created by the hireDrovers function. hireDrovers() pulls drover information from the database tab and randomly arranges it in an array, then that array is stored in the constant drovers.
2. At the bottom of the main module, you will see the following code - `for (const drover of drovers)`. Explain what the values of both the `drover` and the `drovers` variables are.
   > drovers is an array[]       The value of drovers is an array of an exact amount of drovers from an array in the database tab. 
   > drover is an object      The value of drover is value gained by a single iteration over the drovers array. Here is is the first name and last name of one of the drovers in the drovers array.
3. In the **journey** module, there is a `journeyMaker()` function. In that function, there is a variable named `areas` which will have the value of an object. Use your debugger to show what the value of each key is on that object. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com) to record your session.
   > https://www.loom.com/share/abbc3ff7562345c3b53bb6f6f70440d3
4. Also in the **journey** module, there is the following code:
   ```js
   for (let forestNumber = 0; forestNumber < areas.forests; forestNumber++) {
      journey.push("forest")
   }
   ```
   Explain this code with your best vocabulary.
   > This is a for loop. It iterates through the loop as many times as many times as createForests() randomly picked for it to do.
   It then pushes the string "forest" into the journey array
   > for calls for a loop to be made, that loop is made in between the () right after. This is just a for loop iterating through the length of an array of objects. it goes from the first one [0] ; through all the forests in areas ; then adds one more until there are no more to go through then it stops an moves on to the next one. pushing an object into the journey array with every iteration.
5. Explain the value of the `database` variable in the **database** module. Be as comprehensive as possible.
   > database is an array        database is an array that contains 2 objects. the first object has 4 objects that each have 2 key pairs.  The second object has many objects that have 4 key pairs.
6. In the **drovers** module, there is a `hireDrovers()` function. You will notice the following code on that line - `(herdSize)`. What is that defining, and where does it get its value?
   > (herdSize) is a parameter or place holder so that we can fill it with other values later and reuse the function hireDrovers() later if we want to. In this project the parameter herdSize was replaced with the const cattleToDrive = 50. that is located on the main.js page. 

## When You Are Done

After you have answered all the questions above, you need to push all of your code back up to Github. Follow these instructions.

1. Be in the `bug-wrangler-ranch` directory.
2. `git add --all`
3. `git commit -m "Code complete"`
4. `git push origin main`

Then go to the Learning Platform and click the **Self-assessment Complete** button.
